# Discord_Bot
A Bot written in Python able to execute tasks in a Discord server. Also a reason for me to brush up on Python and to play with the discord.py library.

Future features:
  - Allow the user to search for music on YouTube (and other sources) directly from the Discord chat
  - Music should be able to be queued
  - User should be able to create their own custom playlists that they can access at any time
  
Issues:
  - Improve bot command interpretation (currently just a series of ifs)
